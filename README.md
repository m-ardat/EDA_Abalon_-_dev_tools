# EDA_Abalon_&_dev_tools

## Project Description

The project examines the main approaches to data analysis and development tools. Based on physical measurements, predict the age of the abalone.
The repository contains:
- Ñ€exploratory analysis of data from physical measurements of abalone and its age - `EDA_abalone.ipynb`;
- the processes of learning, testing, tuning and interpretation of the machine learning model - `in development`;
- files for deployment and deployment of an interactive dashboard that allows you to track the decision-making process of the model - `in development`.

### EDA
In the process of exploratory analysis, the influence of categorical and continuous features on the target variable was investigated. For each feature, the hypothesis of its significance has been tested by statistical methods.

### ML
`in development`
